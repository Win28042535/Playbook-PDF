# Design DNA — Digital Playbook / Better Trade 2026 (DNA Quiz App)

Source of truth: [dna-quiz-flow.html](dna-quiz-flow.html) — the `:root` block (tokens), the CSS immediately
below it (components), and the `<script>` at the bottom (motion + render logic). **This document is a
read-out of that live file, not a new spec.** If this doc and the CSS ever disagree, the CSS wins — grep
the file (`--fs-`, `--ink`, `.next-step`, etc.) before trusting a number here. Written 2026-08-26 for
design review, last synced 2026-09-17 (see §10); expect it to drift the same way its siblings have (see §11).

**Sibling docs** (this file indexes/condenses them — don't duplicate their detail here):
- [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md) — brand personality, users, product purpose, anti-references
- [TYPOGRAPHY-DNA.md](TYPOGRAPHY-DNA.md) — full type-scale read-out
- [EFINAI-ORB-DNA.md](EFINAI-ORB-DNA.md) — the efin AI orb icon's own DNA
- [GLOW-BORDER-DNA.md](GLOW-BORDER-DNA.md) — the ตัวตน card preview's living rotating comet border
- [AURORA-BACKGROUND-DNA.md](AURORA-BACKGROUND-DNA.md) — the analyzing screen's drifting light-blob background

## 1. Brand voice (condensed from PRODUCT.md)

**"Calm, but credible"** — Kinfolk-inspired editorial restraint, not SaaS-dashboard energy or a loud
gamified event app. In practice:
- **Scenes, not components** — sections are individually composed with white space + hairlines, not
  uniform boxed cards with shadows stacked identically down the page.
- **Spectrum gradient is a rare accent, never a fill** — reserved for interactive/selected moments
  (button borders, underlines, progress) — never a background or resting-state color.
- **Animation enhances, never gates** — every reveal has a `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback; content is
  never hidden behind a class-triggered transition.
- **One source of truth for tokens** — `:root` in this file, not a designer's original spec elsewhere.
- **Device reality first** — attendees use whatever phone/event-tablet is in hand; the type scale is
  fixed across breakpoints (only spacing breathes wider on tablet/pc — see §4).

**Anti-references** (things this app deliberately does *not* look like): generic AI-slop SaaS (uniform
card grids, gradient-text headlines, glassmorphism-as-decoration), and loud badge-heavy confetti-first
gamified event apps.

## 2. Color tokens

```css
--ink:#111318;  --muted:#687078;
--paper:#f7f8f7; --cloud:#eef1f6; --white:#ffffff;
--accent:rgba(17,19,24,0.06);
--line:rgba(17,19,24,0.09); --line-soft:rgba(17,19,24,0.08);
--line-strong:rgba(17,19,24,0.17); --line-header:rgba(17,19,24,0.06);
--focus:#2b6cff; --popover:rgba(255,255,255,0.96);
```

**⚠️ Correction to stale memory:** this app is **light-theme only** — a prior memory note claimed a full
dark-mode token set exists; the live CSS says otherwise verbatim ("Light theme only — dark mode
intentionally removed, per direction: keep the original editorial theme"). Don't re-introduce a
`prefers-color-scheme` branch without a fresh direction.

### 2.1 Brand spectrum (rare accent)
```css
--cyan:#61e8ed; --violet:#9c91ff; --pink:#f178d8; --yellow:#f2ea83;
--spectrum:linear-gradient(90deg,#61e8ed,#9c91ff,#f178d8,#f2ea83,#61e8ed);
```
Used on interactive/accent moments only (Liquid Metal button rim, hero video badge) — never a section
background.

### 2.2 Status-tone ladder — the semantic color system

This is the one place in the file where color carries *meaning*, not just decoration. Four tones, each
with a fixed job — **don't borrow one tone's color for another tone's job** (this has drifted and been
re-collapsed at least twice already, see the inline comments at each token):

| Tone | Meaning | Base color | Wash/bg | Border | Fill/chip | Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Violet** | in progress / active / neutral info | `--violet` | `--active-wash` (10%) | `--active-border` (35%) | `--active-fill` (15%) | `--ink` |
| **Cyan** | done / unlocked | `--cyan` | `--done-wash` (10%) | `--done-border` (35%) | `--done-fill` (15%) | `--ink` |
| **Amber** | needs attention, do this | `--amber-bg:#fef4e2` | — (bg itself) | `--amber-border:#f3daa0` | same as bg | `--amber-text:#8a5a00` |
| **Green** | success / positive outcome | `--green-text:#15803d` | `color-mix(in srgb,var(--green-text) 7%,var(--white))` | `color-mix(in srgb,var(--green-text) 32%,transparent)` | `color-mix(in srgb,var(--green-text) 14%,var(--white))` | `--green-text` |

Cyan/violet are true design tokens (wash/fill/border rungs pre-defined in `:root`); amber is a token trio
too (`--amber-bg/-border/-text`); **green only has one token (`--green-text`)** — every green wash/border
you see is hand-mixed inline via `color-mix()` at point of use (e.g. `.next-step.ds-ok`, `.trait-chip.done`,
`.ds-joined`). If green usage grows, promoting it to a real `--green-bg`/`--green-border` pair (mirroring
amber's shape) is worth a review — see §11.

**Where each tone shows up today:**
- Violet: `.bp-fill` (booth progress bar, not-yet-complete), `.rt-badge.new`, active tab state, `.int-bar-fi` (interest bars, real signal)
- Cyan: `.bp-fill`/`.pe-track-badge.full` once complete, `.bc-play.played`, `.game-row.played`, `.bp-btn.done` (booth partner button, that booth's shared activity genuinely completed — see §10 2026-09-17)
- Amber: `.draw-status`→`.next-step.ds-need` ("ยังขาด"), `.redeem-card.on`, `.prof-tier`, `.rt-badge.feat`, `.bp-btn.chk` (booth partner button, checked in but that booth's activity not done yet — added 2026-09-17 to stop this state collapsing into `.bp-btn.done`'s cyan, see §10)
- Green: `.next-step.ds-ok` ("ครบเงื่อนไขแล้ว" prize-draw success card), `.trait-chip.done`, `.ds-joined` (post-CTA acknowledgment)

---

## 3. Typography (condensed — see TYPOGRAPHY-DNA.md for the full read-out)

Two typefaces: **FC Minimal** (`--font`, UI voice — everything, incl. all Thai text) and **Baskervville**
(`--serif`, editorial display voice — **English display text + numerals only, never Thai**). Both
self-hosted `@font-face`, no CDN dependency — as of the 2026-09-02 asset-extraction pass, the `.ttf`
files live under `assets/` and are referenced by relative `url()`, not inlined as base64 (see §10).

Fixed scale (identical mobile/tablet/pc — only spacing grows on wider viewports, never type size):

| Token | Size | | Token | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--fs-title` | 36px | | `--fs-bodysm` | 18px |
| `--fs-heading` | 28px | | `--fs-label` | 16px |
| `--fs-h2` | 24px | | `--fs-eyebrow` | 14px |
| `--fs-sub` / `--fs-body` | 22px *(2026-08-26, was 20)* | | `--fs-meta` | 14px |

Two rendered weights only: `--w-body`/`--w-head` = 500, `--w-label` = 700. Headlines default to
`letter-spacing:0` (a deliberate signature — don't "fix" it). Uppercase eyebrow labels get `0.02–0.12em`
positive tracking.

---

## 4. Spacing, radius, shadow

Named-by-use-case spacing scale (10 values) — pick the *case* that matches, not a raw px. The
2026-08-31 border/spacing audit rounded ~58 off-grid literals (9/10/14/18/26/28px, etc., that had
drifted in ad hoc) onto the nearest existing rung below — no new tokens were added, this was
compliance cleanup, not a re-tune:

| Token | px | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `--sp-hairline` | 2 | optical nudge only (never a real gap) |
| `--sp-stack-tight` | 4 | title/value → its one caption line |
| `--sp-glue` | 6 | an icon glued to its own label |
| `--sp-list` | 8 *(2026-08-26, was 9)* | gap between repeated rows in one list/stack |
| `--sp-inline` | 12 *(2026-08-26, was 10)* | two related items sharing a row (icon + text) |
| `--sp-stack` | 16 *(2026-08-26, was 14)* | a card's own eyebrow/heading → its body |
| `--sp-card-pad` | 22 *(2026-08-26, was 20)* | a card's inner edge padding |
| `--sp-card-pad-sm` | 16 *(2026-08-26, was 14)* | small (`--r1`) cards' inner padding |
| `--sp-edge` | 20 | the screen's outer gutter |
| `--sp-block` | 22 | one labeled sub-section to the next inside one card |
| `--sp-section` | 20 (24 tablet/pc) | gap between top-level sections on a long scroll |

Radius: `--r0:6px` (micro-chrome — tooltip/focus ring/route badge), `--r1:8px` (small cards), `--r2:16px`
(cards), `--rpill:48px` (pills/buttons). 12px and 24px are reserved, unused — **enforced by the
2026-08-31 border/spacing audit**, which caught 3 consumers (`.ns-ic`, `.scan-mine-qr`, `.scan-note`)
that had drifted onto a stray literal `12px` and repointed them at `var(--r2)`; the "reserved" claim is
now actually true again, not just documented.

Shadows: `--shadow-action`/`--shadow-primary` (buttons — genuine floating controls keep a shadow),
`--shadow-md`/`--shadow-lg` (overlays: demo panel, map lightbox, scan/share/howto sheets). **Cards/
sections themselves carry no shadow** — hairline border only (`--line-soft`), per the "scenes, not
components" principle in §1. `--shadow-lg` was also re-tuned in the 2026-08-31 audit: it now matches
the value already hand-duplicated across the map lightbox + `.scan-card`/`.share-sheet`/`.howto-card`
(instead of an old 24px/64px/.26 definition none of them actually used), and those 4 consumers now
reference the token instead of repeating the literal. `.demo-panel` is the only other `--shadow-lg`
consumer and got marginally stronger as a side effect (dev-only tool, not user-facing).

---

## 5. Icon system

**Default: Lucide** (outline, 24×24 grid, `currentColor`, round caps/joins) — 53 symbols embedded as
inline `<symbol>` defs, rendered via `ic('lc-name')` → an inline `<svg><use></use></svg>`. Stroke width
steps with size: 16px→1.75px, 20/24px→2px. Never filled/duotone/emoji.

**Override: custom PNG icon-set art**, loaded from `assets/*.png` (base64-inlined `data:` URIs until
the 2026-09-02 extraction pass, see §10 — same PNGs, just external files now), for specific domains
where bespoke illustrated icons were supplied (17 images: `ICON_STOCK_TH_PNG`, `ICON_GOLD_PNG`,
`ICON_JOYSTICK_PNG`, `ICON_CROWN_PNG`, etc.). **10 of these 17 (the `BOOTH_ICON_PNG` set) are now
`.webp` on disk as of 2026-09-17 (see §10)** — var names kept as `*_PNG` regardless, same "don't
rename despite the extension change" precedent `GAME_ART_PNG`/`BOOTH_ART_PNG` already established;
check the actual `var X_PNG='assets/...'` string, not the var name, before assuming a format. Every
consumer follows the same **fallback pattern** —
PNG art if this specific key has it, else fall back to the Lucide symbol — so a future entry without
commissioned art never renders broken:
```js
BOOTH_ICON_PNG[b.asset] ? '<img src="'+BOOTH_ICON_PNG[b.asset]+'" alt="">' : ic(b.icon,'bc-asset-ic')
```
Live today on: the 10 booth-zone asset icons (`BOOTH_ICON_PNG`), the 3 ticket-tier badges
(`TIER_ICON_PNG` — crown/gem/compass), and the "เล่นเกมนี้ต่อ"/"ขั้นต่อไป" next-step card's joystick icon
(always-PNG, no Lucide fallback needed there).

**Icon sizing tokens:** `--ic-sm:16px`, `--ic-md:20px`, `--ic-lg:24px` — a PNG `<img>` inside any of these
contexts sizes identically to the SVG it replaces (`.ns-ic img{width:var(--ic-lg);height:var(--ic-lg);
object-fit:contain;}`), so swapping art never shifts a badge's footprint.

---

## 6. Motion DNA

Three independent motion systems, layered, each with its own reduced-motion fallback:

### 6.1 Container Scroll Animation (`.scroll-reveal`)
Every section-level card carries `.scroll-reveal`. `revealTick()` (rAF-throttled, bound to
window+`#root` scroll) computes each element's scroll progress between entering at ~92% down the
viewport and settling flat by ~42%, and applies a 3D tip-back transform that eases out as it scrolls into
place. **Scroll paces the reveal, it never gates content** — nothing is invisible before its transform
settles. `prefers-reduced-motion` collapses straight to flat (`transform:none`).

### 6.2 Chart reveal (`.viz-bar` / `initCharts`)
A one-time `IntersectionObserver` (threshold 0.3) adds `.viz-in` to a chart's containing card the first
time it enters the viewport, then unobserves — **never replays on re-scroll**. Any element with class
`.viz-bar` animates `width:0 → width:var(--tw)` over `.7s` once its ancestor gets `.viz-in`. This is the
one shared idiom behind every bar chart in the app (see §7.3) — a new bar chart should reuse this exact
mechanism, not invent its own reveal.

### 6.3 Liquid Metal buttons
A ported shader-based button component (`js/liquid-metal-button.js` + `js/liquid-metal-cta.js`, ES
modules, ships its own WebGL rim shader with a CSS-gradient fallback if WebGL fails). Three size presets
— `hero` (splash CTA, standalone), `cta` (in-card single action — next-step, prize-draw), `compact`
(header QR pill, secondary CTAs) — same rainbow rim palette and white pill fill at every size, so every
Liquid Metal button reads as one family. Mounted imperatively per-render via
`mountLiquidMetalButtonInto('#slotId','cta',{label,icon,onClick})` into a slot the markup leaves empty,
since this SPA replaces `root.innerHTML` wholesale on every render (see §9.2).

---

## 7. Component library

### 7.1 Buttons
- `.btn.btn-primary` — ink fill / cloud text, 48px pill, the plain-CSS default action button.
- Liquid Metal (§6.3) — for the app's genuine "the one thing to tap" CTAs inside a card.
- `.howto-btn` — light-bordered pill (white bg, ink text) for a secondary/info action ("วิธีเล่น").

### 7.2 Cards
- `.home-card` — the generic top-level section card (hairline border, `--r2`, no shadow).
- **`.next-step`** — the reusable "one prominent action" card: an icon badge (`.ns-ic`, 48px rounded
  square) beside an eyebrow/title/body text block (`.ns-tx` → `.ns-ey`/`.ns-t`/`.ns-b`), with a CTA slot
  (`.ns-cta-slot`) as a third flex sibling that wraps full-width/right-aligned on mobile. Originally the
  ink-dark hero-style card (Home's "ขั้นต่อไป", Games' "เล่นเกมนี้ต่อ"); **as of 2026-08-26 also reskinned
  via tone modifiers** (`.next-step.ds-ok` green, `.next-step.ds-need` amber) for the booth prize-draw
  card — same icon-badge/eyebrow/title/body/cta-slot layout, just recolored per the status-tone ladder in
  §2.2 instead of ink. **This is the pattern to reuse next time a new "one action, in a card" moment
  needs a home** — don't invent a fourth bespoke card shape for it.
- `.conf-box` — the Confidence Score card (sub-score bars + a `.conf-foot` note+CTA row, itself using the
  full-width `.btn.btn-primary` shape, not Liquid Metal, for its "เล่นเกม 6 ด้าน" button). **Also reused
  as-is by `skillCardHTML()`** for the SKILL ประจำการ์ด card (title + `.skc-chiprow` + `.conf-bars` rows,
  same shell) — a second consumer of the same class, not a fork. Its "ยังขาด" badge (amber `.sc.act`
  chip beside the title, laid out via a `.trait-hd` flex wrapper shared with `.skc-t`) was removed
  2026-09-01 per direction; `.trait-hd` was deleted with it since nothing else used that wrapper, and
  `.skc-t` went back to its own default margin instead of the inline zero it used to need.
- **`.pass-card`'s multi-ticket variant** (2026-09-02, `DEMO.multiTicket` demo-panel preview only — see
  §9.1) — **zero new classes.** `passCardMultiHTML()` just repeats the exact single-ticket block above
  (`.pass-ey`+icon, `.pass-name.pn-indent`, `.pass-benefit`, `.pass-foot` price row) once per held
  ticket inside the one card, pulling each ticket's ประเภทบัตร/สิทธิ/ราคา from the same `TIER_META`
  lookup `curTier()` reads. Only ticket #1 keeps the chevron and the "บัตรของคุณ" eyebrow text; ticket
  2+ gets "บัตรใบที่ N" and a hairline `border-top` divider (same technique `.pass-foot` already uses)
  ahead of it. A same-day first pass here tried a bespoke combined-summary layout (icon badge + tier
  pill row + one "unlocked X of Y" line) — scrapped once directed to reuse the single-ticket DNA
  verbatim instead of inventing a new card shape.
- **Profile's `ticketHistoryHTML()`** (2026-09-02, `DEMO.multiTicket` only) — also zero new classes: it
  reuses `sidesHTML()`'s "6 ด้านที่วัดได้จากคุณ" list DNA verbatim (`.card`/`.sides-hd`/`.s-ey`/`.s-h`/
  `.s-sub` for the header, `.side-item`/`.side-row`/`.side-num`/`.side-cx`/`.side-t`/`.side-s`/`.side-r`/
  `.sc` per row) rather than the bespoke `.tkt-hist`/`.tkt-row` set a same-day first pass built — see
  §9.1. `.side-num.done`/`.sc.done` (ink circle, the ladder's own green "complete" chip) both already
  mean "settled/valid," reused as-is for "ใช้งานได้"; no expand/collapse, since a ticket has nothing
  further to reveal the way a 6-ด้าน row's body does.

### 7.3 Bars & charts — three idioms, one reveal mechanism
All three share the `.viz-bar` reveal (§6.2) and a `grid-template-columns:1fr auto` row shape
(label+value on top, a full-width track below), so a new metric can be dropped into whichever idiom fits
without inventing new motion:

| Idiom | Series | Used for | Color |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.trait-row` | single value/max | คะแนนพฤติกรรม (behavior score) | violet→cyan gradient fill |
| `.alloc-bar`/`.alloc-seg` | stacked % segments + legend | แผนจัดพอร์ตที่แนะนำ (recommended allocation) | 4-hue palette, softened 55% toward white |
| `.int-bar-row` | single %, sorted desc | เรดาร์ความสนใจ (interest bars) | full violet (touched) / pale violet tint (muted) — **same hue family, not gray**, per direction |

**Real-data discipline:** `.int-bar-row`'s % is computed from genuine `BOOTH_CHK`/`BOOTH_ACT` signal, not
invented — the file's own comment history flags this explicitly ("NOT a fabricated per-category %") and
it's worth checking before adding a new bar chart: if there's no real signal behind a number, either tag
the section `.ex-tag` "ตัวอย่าง" (§8) or don't ship the bar at all.

### 7.4 Chips, pills, badges
- `.ex-tag` — the "ตัวอย่าง" (example/mock data) marker pill — see §8.
- `.ds-chip` / `.trait-chip` — small status pills, tone-colored per §2.2.
- `.route-badge`, `.rt-badge` (`.pick`/`.feat`/`.new` variants) — booth-route status pills.

### 7.5 Navigation
- `.book-tabbar` — the app-shell bottom tab bar (5 tabs: หน้าหลัก/คู่มือของคุณ/เดินบูธ/เกมหลัก/โปรไฟล์).
- `.bt-tabs--secondary` (pill row) — Book v2's in-page sub-nav (ตัวตน/วิเคราะห์/พอร์ต/เส้นทาง).
- `.bt-tabs--primary` — asset drill-down tabs ("เจาะรายสินทรัพย์").

---

## 8. Content conventions

- **"ตัวอย่าง" (example) tagging** — any section built on illustrative/mocked data (no real backing
  measurement yet, e.g. `traitBars()`, `allocBars()`) carries a visible `<span class="ex-tag">ตัวอย่าง</span>`
  next to its heading. This is a house rule, not a one-off: **never present mocked data as if it were the
  user's real measured result** — tag it, or compute it from something real (see §7.3's `.int-bar-row`
  discipline).
- **No fabricated percentages** — when a real signal exists (booth check-ins, quiz picks, game plays),
  prefer deriving a chart's numbers from it over hand-picking illustrative ones, even for a demo.
- **Thai/English serif split** — Baskervville (`--serif`) never renders Thai text, full stop. See
  TYPOGRAPHY-DNA.md §"Hard rule."
- **Mock interactions still acknowledge the tap** — buttons with no real backend (post-event
  "ดาวน์โหลด", prize-draw "ร่วมลุ้นรางวัล") flip to a small "…แล้ว (ตัวอย่าง)" acknowledgment state on
  click rather than doing nothing, so the prototype never feels unresponsive.

---

## 9. Dev / review tooling conventions

Two standing mechanisms exist specifically to support design review (not real end-user features) — worth
knowing about since they're how this app is normally reviewed:

### 9.1 "จำลองเคส" demo panel (`buildDemo()` / `.demo-panel`)
A floating dev panel (bottom-right FAB, `id="demoFab"`) simulating states that would otherwise require
real interaction to reach: viewport preset, ticket tier, a persona shortcut, quiz-done toggle, and —
as of this session — **explicit force-toggles for edge-case states** (e.g. `DEMO.draw`: อัตโนมัติ/
ครบเงื่อนไขแล้ว/ยังขาด for the prize-draw card) so both branches of a conditional UI can be previewed
without manually driving the real counters to the threshold. **When a new screen has a meaningful
if/else state, add a demo-panel override for it** — this has become the established way to make a state
reviewable. **`DEMO.multiTicket`** (2026-09-02) is the newest example: a "จำนวนบัตร" toggle previewing a
customer holding 2 tickets at once (see §7.2's `.pass-card` multi-ticket bullet) — default OFF,
single-ticket stays the real/active state, and it's scoped to just Home + Profile, not a reinterpretation of the
`สิทธิ์ของคุณ` `curTier()` select every other gate in the file still reads.

### 9.2 Version-preview toggles (retired pattern — `BOOK_VER`, `POSTER_VER`)
Global vars (not real user-facing settings) that let the demo panel A/B two implementations of the same
screen side-by-side during a redesign (Book v1 vs v2, Poster v1/v2/v3) before one is retired. Once a
version "won," the loser was usually kept reachable via the panel for a while rather than deleted
immediately, in case review reopened it — but both examples here have since had their loser actually
deleted once no one reopened it: `POSTER_VER` (2026-08-29, only V3 ever reachable) and `BOOK_VER`
(2026-08-30, "ลบ คู่มือ 1 ออก" — คู่มือ 1's `renderBook()` removed, `renderBook2()` renamed to
`renderBook`). Neither var exists in the code anymore; this section stays as a record of the pattern
for the next time a version A/B is needed, not as a pointer to live code.

---

## 10. What changed most recently

For quick orientation on what's newest and least battle-tested — worth a closer look in review.
Newest first; each session's own commit(s) are named so you can `git show` for the full diff.

**2026-09-17 — efin.finance check-in gate for เกมหลัก + partial-completion warning.** The เกมหลัก
page's own copy has always promised "เช็คอินที่บูธ efin.finance...เพื่อปลดล็อกทั้ง 6 เกม" (the
pre-event "Coming soon" empty state below), but that promise only ever showed pre-event — once
`eventPhase==='on'`, every one of the 6 games was openable with zero gate, the same "promised in
copy, never wired" gap the booth check-in gate had before its own 2026-09-09 fix. Added a new state
flag, `EFIN_CHECKED_IN` (a separate physical check-in point from the 10 asset booths, confirmed with
direction), gating `openPlay('game',...)` until true. The locked state **reuses the pre-event "Coming
soon" card's exact DNA verbatim** (`.ev-empty-ic`/`.shimmer-ink`/`.shimmer-violet`/`.ast-block`, §7/§6
— only the PNG icon and copy changed, not the structure), and the header's existing "สแกน QR" pill
(`mountHeaderQR()`) became phase-aware — it opens a new `SCAN.bi==='efin'` branch of the same scan
modal (§ "QR SCAN MODAL") while on เกมหลัก and not yet checked in, instead of a dedicated new button.
Also added a "เล่นไม่ครบมีผลมาก" note (shown while <6 games are done) — plain copy only (no numeric
weighting system exists to back a real score), built on **`.pe-report`/`.pe-report-t`/`.pe-report-s`
verbatim**, the same DNA as Home's "รายงานพัฒนาการหลังงาน" card (§7.2's reuse-don't-invent discipline
applied to both of these). Demo panel (§9.1) gained a "เช็คอิน efin.finance" toggle. Verified live:
lock/unlock round-trips cleanly via the real scan flow, booth check-in's own generic scan (`SCAN.bi
==null`) unaffected, no console errors.

**2026-09-17 (same session, earlier) — booth partner check-in split into its own amber "checked in"
state, distinct from cyan "activity done."** `.bp-btn` (the per-partner QR button on a booth card)
only ever read `BOOTH_CHK` and rendered `.done` (cyan/`--done-fill`) the instant a partner was
checked in — collapsing the booth-legend's own 3 states (ยังไม่เช็คอิน/เช็คอินแล้ว/ร่วมกิจกรรมแล้ว,
§2.2) down to 2, since the legend's amber "เช็คอินแล้ว" middle state never actually rendered. Added
`.bp-btn.chk` (amber, the same 3 tokens `.next-step.ds-need` uses) for "checked in, that booth's
shared activity (`BOOTH_ACT[bi]`, booth-wide — one game per booth, not per partner) not done yet";
`.bp-btn.done` now only fires once `BOOTH_ACT[bi]` is true too, so every checked-in partner under a
booth flips from amber to cyan together the moment that booth's game is completed. Verified live at
both states plus the existing demo-seeded default.

**2026-09-16/17 — responsive audit, touch-target fixes, and a run of DNA-consistency passes
(one session, several direction rounds — see `git log` on this range for individual commits).**
Grouped here since they share one session but touch unrelated surfaces:
- **Touch targets**: a scripted audit (§ this section's own 2026-09-02/09-03 precedent) flagged 6
  interactive elements under the 44×44px minimum — `.bp-btn`, `.howto-btn` (cascades to `.bc-play`),
  `.gr-hd .btn-primary`, `.bt-tabs--primary`/`--secondary .bt-tab`, `.mp-zoom` — all bumped to
  `min-height:44px`. `.bmk` (the 26px map-pin marker) got an invisible `::before` hit-area instead
  of padding (padding would have shifted `.bmk-ring`/`.bmk-lbl`'s own position math, both anchored to
  `.bmk`'s box) — same "small icon, bigger tap zone" technique as native platform guidance, verified
  via `elementFromPoint()` at an offset outside the visible circle, not just a bounding-rect read.
- **Games-page icon DNA aligned to `.pass-ey-ic`**: "สิ่งที่ได้เรียนรู้จากเกมนี้"'s icon swapped
  `lc-check-circle` → `ICON_JOYSTICK_PNG`, and `.gr-ic` (the "ด้านอื่นใน Playbook" row icon) dropped
  its bordered 48px square frame — both now bare icons at `width:var(--ic-lg);height:auto`, the exact
  same recipe `.pass-ey-ic` (Home's "ความคืบหน้าของ Playbook") already used. `.gr-ic`'s box had been
  tried bare once before (2026-09-11) and reverted to a bordered badge same-day; this reverts it back
  again, this time confirmed to stay.
- **Result-screen save-note reskinned + หมายเหตุ repositioned**: `saveNoteHTML` ("บันทึกเรื่องที่
  เรียนรู้...") moved off `.pf-note` (Profile footer's flat muted line) onto `.pe-report.on`/
  `.pe-report-t`/`.pe-report-s` — the same icon+title+subtitle-on-done-wash DNA as Home's "รายงาน
  พัฒนาการหลังงาน" card (title/subtitle text also split, weights 700/500) — and its icon sized up via
  a scoped `.pe-report-lg` modifier to match the result screen's other icon-led sections (`.str-hd`/
  `.ast-lbl`/`.hero-note.skill-note`, all `--ic-lg`/24px; the base `.pe-report svg` stays `--ic-md`/
  20px for Home's own card). The noType "หมายเหตุ" note (`.hero-note.skill-note`) was pulled out of
  its old position (between insBox and resultCard) and now always renders dead-last on the page,
  after saveNoteHTML — genuinely bottom-most regardless of game type, not just bottom-of-one-variable.
- **Points UI removed entirely.** Every "+N แต้ม" surface in the app — `.play-pts-badge` (question
  screen), `.bp-pts`/`.pe-report` "สะสมแล้ว" running total (booth list), the briefing's "รางวัล" card
  (booth pre-game brief) — removed per direction ("เอาออกทั้งหมด"), continuing the 2026-09-11 removal
  of the same reward card on the end-of-game screen. `boothPointsTotal()`/`.play-sum-pts`/
  `.play-pts-badge` CSS and `ptsCountUp()` left in place, unused — same "kept for history" precedent
  §9.2 documents for retired version-toggles. Booth briefs now show only the "จำนวนข้อ" card, centered
  at its original half-width (`.round-cards.single`) rather than stretched full-width once its "รางวัล"
  sibling was gone.
- **Asset-weight pass**: the 10 `BOOTH_ICON_PNG` category icons converted PNG→WebP (canvas
  `toBlob('image/webp',0.8)`, no resize — already at/under their largest real display size, 80px@2x
  — see §5's own note): 318.9KB → 48.2KB combined, ~85% smaller. Main-games result-screen art (§7,
  `GAME_ART_PNG`, temporarily `null`'d 2026-09-16 pending a new set) restored with a freshly-supplied
  6-image set, already carrying clean per-pixel alpha (unlike every prior `GAME_ART_PNG` source, which
  needed flood-fill background removal) — resized 1254px→360px + WebP q0.8: ~7.86MB → ~188KB total.
- **Content/copy pass**: home hero poster trimmed (dropped the `.hh-badge` eyebrow line, new
  subtext), the booth "วิธีเล่น" modal and draw-eligibility copy updated (its deadline line removed),
  Profile's footer rewritten (brand name + tagline lines bumped to `--w-label`/700).

**2026-09-10 — responsive audit: real tablets stuck rendering the mobile phone-frame, header/content/
bottom-nav not filling the screen.** Per direction "responsive audit" with device screenshots (real
iPad Safari + Android Chrome, portrait, ~768–874px wide) showing the header, `.book-tabbar`, and card
content all clamped into a narrow centered column with large empty margins on both sides — matches
the `.shell{max-width:400px}` "phone-frame preview" look, not the tablet layout. Root cause: the
2026-08-26 change ("`อัตโนมัติ` default ไว้ที่ mobile size") made `applyView()`'s `'auto'` branch
resolve to `'mobile'` unconditionally, dropping the old `window.innerWidth` check entirely — so ANY
real visitor who never touches the demo panel's `มุมมอง` segmented control (i.e. everyone) got
`data-view="mobile"` regardless of actual device width, contradicting this doc's own "Device reality
first" principle (§ above: attendees use whatever phone/event-tablet is in hand) and silently
undoing the 2026-09-02/09-03 tablet-width audits' premise that `data-view` tracks the real viewport.
Fixed by restoring real-width detection inside the `'auto'` branch only (`w<768→mobile /
w<1440→tablet / else pc`) while leaving the demo panel's explicit PC/แท็บเล็ต/มือถือ overrides
untouched — so a genuine tablet auto-resolves to `data-view="tablet"` (verified via
`getBoundingClientRect()`, not just a screenshot: at 768px, `.shell`/`.topbar`/`.book-tabbar` went
from 400px to 753px) while the demo panel can still force any of the three states for previewing off
real hardware. See `applyView()` in dna-quiz-flow.html.

**2026-09-03 — scroll motion bug: `revealTick()`'s "กิจกรรมประจำโซน" card arriving nearly a full page
late on tall phones (iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max reported).** Root cause wasn't a device- or width-specific
breakpoint — it was `revealTick()` (§ "CONTAINER SCROLL ANIMATION DNA") reading `el.getBoundingClientRect()`
**without clearing the element's own transform from the previous tick first**. That's harmless for a
normal-height `.scroll-reveal` card, but `perspective(1000px) rotateX(12deg)` foreshortens a rotated
box more the taller it is relative to that 1000px perspective distance — negligible on a ~480px card,
severe on this section's booth-grid card (~1700px tall on mobile, one column). The distorted
mid-rotation box fed its own (wrong) `rect.top` into the NEXT tick's progress calc, so `p` chased a
moving target and never converged until the user had scrolled nearly the section's own height past
it — reading as "leaves a blank gap for almost the whole page before it shows up". Fixed two ways in
`revealTick()`: (1) clear `el.style.transform` before reading `rect` each tick, so `p` is always
computed from the TRUE scrolled position, not last frame's distorted paint (costs one extra reflow
per `.scroll-reveal` element per tick — negligible at the handful this app has); (2) scale
`perspective` with the element's own height (`Math.max(1000, rect.height*2.2)`, same 1000px floor as
before for anything at/under that height) so a very tall card foreshortens by about the same visual
amount as a short one under the same 12deg tilt, instead of collapsing harder the taller it is.
Verified via direct `getBoundingClientRect()`/`offsetHeight` reads (not just eyeballing — this bug is
invisible in a single screenshot, only shows up as a timing error across a scroll range) that the
section now converges to its natural height within the same ~0.5×vh scroll window every other
`.scroll-reveal` card gets, at both reported sizes (iPhone 15 Pro 393×852, Pro Max 430×932) plus the
full 393/402/420/430/440 (phone) and 800/820/834/884 (tablet) width set from the audit below — and
re-ran that audit's own 0-overflow sweep after the change since `revealTick()` is shared by every
screen, not just this one card. No other `.scroll-reveal` section changed behavior (all comfortably
under the old fixed 1000px perspective's safe height already).

**2026-09-03 — responsive audit: tablet 800/820/834/884px + phone 393/402/420/430/440px, clean (no code change).** Per direction "responsive audit" for these two specific width bands — same
`scrollWidth`/`clientWidth` sweep methodology as the 2026-09-02 entry below, run fresh against this
session's own harness: `st.phase` forced through all 10 screens (splash/consent/quiz/reveal/book/
library/home/passport/games/profile) × all 3 `data-view` states (mobile/tablet/pc, incl. every
mismatched real-width/data-view combo the 2026-09-02 fixes were about) × both `DEMO.eventPhase`
values (pre/on, since on-event is what mounts the 3-item `.topbar` — logo + reg-cta + QR pill —
that was the last real bug found) × all 9 target widths = 540 checks, 0 overflows. Cross-checked
with direct `getBoundingClientRect()` reads (not just screenshots — screenshots taken immediately
after a `data-view` switch under-read `.shell`'s width because of its own `.shell{transition:
max-width .3s}`, and can visually mis-render viewports wider than the preview pane's own physical
size; neither is a real bug, just artifacts of testing too fast / too wide — verify geometry via
JS rects when a screenshot taken right after a state change looks implausible) on the two specific
prior fix points (`.str-grid{flex-direction:column}` and `.next-step`'s narrow-phone grid-template,
both keyed off `max-width:420px` regardless of `data-view`) at the 420px boundary — both hold.
**Conclusion: nothing in this file needed a fix for these 9 widths** — the 320–480px hardening from
prior sessions already covers the phone band, and 800–884px falls inside the same "no breakpoint
lives here" gap the file already had between 640px and 1024px (data-view carries the layout, not a
raw `@media` at these widths), so tablet holds too. Documented here so a future session doesn't
re-run the identical sweep from scratch assuming these ranges were never checked.

**2026-09-02 — responsive audit: `.topbar` overflow at 320px, on-event.** Per direction "responsive
audit" — scripted a `scrollWidth`/`clientWidth` sweep (not visual spot-checks) across every screen ×
`data-view` × real width (320/375/768/1280px), 17 screen-states × 3 views × 4 widths. Found exactly one
genuine overflow: on-event, `.topbar` holds 3 items at once (`.tb-logo` + `.reg-cta` "ลงทะเบียน"
[`flex-shrink:0`, never compresses] + `#qr-cta-slot`'s mounted "สแกน QR" button) — reproduces on every
screen showing this header combo (Home/Games/Booth via `appHeader()`, Book via its own pre-`appHeader()`
duplicate header at line ~3988 — see the open item below), but **only at 320–329px**, a genuinely
narrow window (confirmed clean at 330/340/375px via the same script). Fixed by tightening just the gap
between the 3 items from `--sp-inline` (12px) to `--sp-glue` (6px) at `max-width:340px` — closes the 6px
shortfall with margin, verified via the same sweep script (0 overflow found, re-run at all 4 widths)
before and after, not just a visual re-check. Re-ran the full sweep clean afterward at 320/375/768/1280.

**Methodology note for next time:** the sweep script's first draft leaked `DEMO` state between
screen-setups (not resetting `eventPhase`/`RESULT`/etc. per iteration), which combined with render()'s
own on-event redirect gate (§ "On-Event gate" near `function render()`) silently substituted `home`/
`book` for several screens the script THOUGHT it was testing as `splash`/`consent`/etc. — inflated the
first pass's finding count with mislabeled duplicates of the same real bug. Second draft resets all
demo/session state at the top of every screen-setup call; trust that version's results, not the first.

**2026-09-02 — multi-ticket demo preview (new feature, default OFF), revised same day.** Per direction
"จำลองเคส...ลูกค้าบัตร 1 แบบ / บัตร 2 แบบ...แต่ยังให้ active ที่กรณีลูกค้าบัตร 1 แบบ" — added
`DEMO.multiTicket` (demo-panel "จำนวนบัตร" toggle, §9.1) previewing a customer holding 2 tickets at
once (a fixed Explorer + Master Class combo, `MULTI_TICKET_DEMO`), scoped to exactly the 2 screens
asked for. **First pass** invented a bespoke combined-summary look for both screens (an icon-badge +
tier-pill-row pass-card with a "7 จาก 9 สิทธิ" line; a different demo persona name/photo on Profile; a
new `.tkt-hist` card). **Follow-up direction the same day** asked for the opposite instinct — reuse
existing DNA, don't invent — so it was rebuilt:
- **Home's pass-card** (`passCardMultiHTML()`) — no combined summary; repeats the single-ticket
  ประเภทบัตร/สิทธิ/ราคา block (§7.2) once per ticket, reading the same `TIER_META` `curTier()` uses.
- **Profile** — chips row unchanged from the first pass (one `.prof-tier` pill per ticket); photo/name/
  org now stay identical to the single-ticket demo ("ออนไลน์ แอสเซ็ท") rather than a different persona;
  the "ประวัติการซื้อบัตร" section (`ticketHistoryHTML()`) now reuses `sidesHTML()`'s "6 ด้านที่วัดได้
  จากคุณ" list DNA verbatim instead of a bespoke card (§7.2).

**Deliberately NOT touched:** every other `curTier()` read in the file (booth map personalization,
prize-draw eligibility, the post-event upgrade CTA, etc.) — the direction only asked for these 2
screens, and "what tier level should 2 combined tickets resolve to for gating elsewhere" was never
specified, so it stays out of scope rather than guessed at. Verified (both passes): default
(`multiTicket:false`) renders byte-identical to before on both screens; toggling on/off round-trips
cleanly with no console errors, on mobile and tablet.

**Second follow-up, same day** — 3 small fixes: `ticketHistoryHTML()`'s "ทุกบัตรที่คุณถือ" eyebrow lost
the icon it had gained in the first rebuild (`sidesHTML()`'s own eyebrow never had one either — this
was drift, not a deliberate difference). `.pass-ey{align-items:center}` → `flex-start` — the tier icon
(24px) is visibly taller than the eyebrow's own small text, so centering let it overhang above and
below the label; this also affects the single-ticket card (harmless — same fix applies either way).
`passCardMultiHTML()`'s first ticket no longer keeps the "บัตรของคุณ" eyebrow — once there's more than
one ticket, ALL of them read "บัตรใบที่ N" (1, 2, ...); "บัตรของคุณ" is reserved for the true
single-ticket card alone, not mixed with "บัตรใบที่ 2" on ticket 1.

**2026-09-02 — asset extraction (repo-size fix, no visual change).** `dna-quiz-flow.html` had grown to
~54MB because every image/video/font was inlined as a base64 `data:` URI directly in JS variables
(`ICON_*_PNG`, `LOGO_IMG`, `BG_IMG`, `ASSET_IMG`, `REAL_CARD_IMG`, `BG_VIDEO`, the 3 `@font-face` rules)
— GitHub started warning on push once it crossed the 50MB recommended-max. Pulled all 53 embedded
assets out to real files under `assets/` (biggest wins: the 22.7MB home hero video and the 13.8MB
booth-map PNG) and replaced each data URI with a relative path string — since JS just interpolates
these vars into `src="..."`/`url(...)` either way, **no consuming code needed to change**, only the
RHS of each `var NAME=`/`key:` assignment. `dna-quiz-flow.html` dropped to ~540KB; `assets/` holds the
~38MB of actual binary content (base64 itself was inflating the text by ~33% on top of that). Verified
line-by-line that only the 29 known asset-declaration lines changed (nothing else in the file moved),
and confirmed live that video/map/card art/icons/fonts all still load with no console errors after the
swap. Git history before this commit still has the old ~54MB blob in it — this only stops it from
growing further, it doesn't shrink already-pushed history (that needs a separate, more invasive
history-rewrite pass if ever wanted).

**2026-09-02 — video compression (same-day follow-up).** `assets/sky.mp4` (the home hero background,
§7 doesn't cover it since it's markup not a component, but it's the `.hh-video` behind "คู่มือลงทุนของ
คุณ") was the single biggest asset — probed with ffprobe and found it was a raw **3364×2464 @ ~17Mbps**
export, way past what `.hh-video{object-fit:cover}` ever needs (the card it fills tops out at 760px
wide on tablet/pc, less on mobile). Re-encoded with ffmpeg — installed one-time as a scratch npm
package (`ffmpeg-static`/`ffprobe-static`), not a system install — to 1280px-wide H.264, CRF 28,
`+faststart`, no audio track (there wasn't one to begin with): **17MB → 1.1MB**, a further ~15×
reduction on top of the extraction above. Compared a same-timestamp frame from both versions side by
side before committing to the swap — visually indistinguishable at the video's real display size.
Verified live: same 8.04s duration, still autoplays/loops/plays muted, no console errors.

**2026-09-02 — map image compression (same-day follow-up).** `assets/MAP_IMG.png` (the booth floorplan,
`.mp-img` inline preview + `.ml-img` fullscreen lightbox) was next biggest at 10.37MB — a raw
3657×2772 RGBA export, again far past what either consumer displays at (`.ml-card{max-width:720px}`
caps even the "zoomed in" lightbox). Converted to **WebP** instead of just downscaling the PNG, since
it has real alpha transparency (the floorplan's diagonal silhouette sits on `.map-ph`'s own gradient
background, not a bounding box) that a plain JPEG swap would have lost. Scaled to 2200px wide (~3× the
720px display cap, generous headroom for the small zone-label text) at WebP quality 90: **10.37MB →
0.32MB**, ~32× smaller. Compared crops of the same real-world region (the "Alternative Investment
ZONE"/"Health ZONE" labels) between the original and two quality candidates (90 and 85) before picking
— text stayed crisp at both, went with 90 for the larger safety margin at negligible extra size (~100KB
between them). Verified live: preview thumbnail and the fullscreen lightbox zoom both render sharp, no
console errors, transparency intact.

**2026-09-02 — icon-set outlier cleanup (same-day follow-up).** 4 of the 17 custom PNG icons
(`ICON_GOLD_PNG`, `ICON_HEALTH_PNG`, `ICON_JOYSTICK_PNG`, `ICON_HOURGLASS_PNG` — 1.5–2.6MB each, ~8.7MB
combined) turned out to be raw **1920×1920** exports that never got downsized like their 13 siblings,
which all sit at a consistent 240×240 (~90–130KB each). Every consumer displays these at 24–48px
(`.bc-asset-ic`/`.ns-ic`/`.ev-empty-ic`) — even 3× retina only ever needs ~144px. Downscaled all 4 to
the same 240×240 the rest of the set already uses (lanczos filter, kept PNG for consistency with the
siblings rather than introducing a third format): **~8.7MB → ~0.35MB**, ~25× smaller. Verified each
visually at 240×240 before swapping (still sharp, illustrated-glass style holds up fine at this size)
and live in its real context — booth-zone rows (gold bars, health heart), the games next-step card
(joystick), and the Games "Coming soon" empty state (hourglass) — no console errors.

**2026-09-01** (`894dc5e`) — two unrelated fixes in one commit:
- Glow border (`.hero-glow-spin`'s conic-gradient) reworked for a longer spectrum + softer graduated
  tail — stop positions/angles only, motion/mask technique untouched. Detailed in full in
  [GLOW-BORDER-DNA.md](GLOW-BORDER-DNA.md) §7–§8 (kept in sync there, not duplicated here).
- `skillCardHTML()`'s "ยังขาด" badge removed per direction — see the `.conf-box` bullet in §7.2.

**2026-08-31** (`32aad80`, "Border & spacing audit") — compliance cleanup, no new tokens or visual
redesign: 3 stray `border-radius:12px` consumers repointed at `var(--r2)`, `--shadow-lg` aligned to
the value already duplicated across 4 overlay cards, ~58 off-grid spacing literals rounded onto the
existing scale. Full detail folded into §4 above. Verified in-browser (no console errors, no
clipping/overlap) across Book, Home, and demo-panel screens.

**2026-08-26** (token re-tune + content additions, folded into their sections above rather than kept
here as a separate list): `--fs-sub`/`--fs-body` 20→22px; `--sp-list` 9→8, `--sp-inline` 10→12,
`--sp-stack`/`--sp-card-pad-sm` 14→16, `--sp-card-pad` 20→22 (see §3/§4). Booth-zone icon-set
completed (all 10 zones now have bespoke PNG icons, §5). New **green** status tone added (§2.2) —
still the newest tone, only one hand-mixed token deep, unchanged since. `.next-step` extended with
tone modifiers `ds-ok`/`ds-need` (§7.2) and `.int-bar-row` interest-bar chart added (§7.3) — both
still current, no further changes since.

---

## 11. Open items for review

- **Green tone is under-tokenized** relative to cyan/violet/amber — only `--green-text` exists; every
  wash/border is an inline `color-mix()`. Worth promoting to a real token trio if green usage grows past
  its current 3 consumers.
- **`.next-step` now serves two visual jobs** (ink-dark hero card *and* light tone-colored status card) —
  confirm this dual-purpose is intentional going forward, not a shortcut that should fork into two
  components once one of them grows more custom needs.
- **`.conf-box` now serves two jobs too** (Confidence Score card *and* the SKILL card via
  `skillCardHTML()`, §7.2) — same watch-out as `.next-step` above: fine while both stay simple rows +
  a foot/chip row, worth a second look if either grows bespoke needs the other shouldn't inherit.
- **`.pe-report` picked up a third job as of 2026-09-17** (Home's "รายงานพัฒนาการหลังงาน" progress
  card, the result-screen save-note, *and* the เกมหลัก partial-completion warning, §10) — same
  watch-out as `.next-step`/`.conf-box` above, plus a real size split already: the base rule stays
  `--ic-md`/20px for Home's card, while a scoped `.pe-report-lg` modifier bumps it to `--ic-lg`/24px
  for the result-screen instance (to match that screen's OTHER icon-led sections). Worth confirming
  this two-size split is intentional-and-final rather than a sign `.pe-report` needs a size prop.
- **This doc itself will go stale** — the same way `design-dna-bt2026` (memory) and the sibling `.md`
  files already have, per their own admitted history. Re-grep `:root` and the component classes named
  here before trusting a specific value in a future review.
- **Book's header is a hand-duplicated `appHeader()`** (line ~3988, predates `appHeader()` existing as a
  shared helper — see the 2026-09-02 responsive-audit entry in §10) — unlike `appHeader()`, it renders
  `#qr-cta-slot` unconditionally instead of omitting it in Pre-Event. Harmless today (an unmounted empty
  slot is 0-width, `mountHeaderQR()` already no-ops in Pre-Event), but it's still a second copy of the
  same markup that can silently drift from `appHeader()` again — worth switching Book to call
  `appHeader()` directly next time this file is touched.
